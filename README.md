uv run python qadi_simple_multi.py "How can we reduce plastic waste?"

# With manual question type override
uv run python qadi_simple_multi.py --type=business "How to monetize AI technology"

# Concrete mode for implementation-focused results
uv run python qadi_simple_multi.py --concrete "Build a mobile app for food delivery"

# Quick single-prompt version
uv run python qadi.py "How can we reduce plastic waste?"
```

# Evaluate with verbose output
uv run mad-spark evaluate "Blockchain social media platform" --verbose

# Compare multiple ideas
uv run mad-spark compare "Business communication" -r "Traditional email" -r "AI video messages" -r "Holographic cards"

# Batch evaluate multiple files
echo "Smart mirrors with personalized compliments" > idea1.txt
uv run mad-spark batch-evaluate idea1.txt idea2.txt

# List available evaluators
uv run mad-spark list-evaluators

# Run genetic evolution demo
uv run python examples/evolution_demo.py
```

### Python API

```python
import asyncio
from mad_spark_alt.core import SmartQADIOrchestrator

async def generate_ideas():
    orchestrator = SmartQADIOrchestrator()  # Uses LLM agents automatically
    result = await orchestrator.run_qadi_cycle(
        problem_statement="How can we reduce plastic waste?",
        cycle_config={"max_ideas_per_method": 3}
    )
    
    print(f"Generated {len(result.synthesized_ideas)} ideas")
    for idea in result.synthesized_ideas[:3]:
        print(f"ðŸ’¡ {idea.content}")

asyncio.run(generate_ideas())
```

## Dynamic Prompt Engineering

The system automatically detects question types and adapts prompts for optimal results:

**Auto-Detected Question Types**:
- **Technical**: Software architecture, implementation, coding questions
- **Business**: Strategy, growth, revenue, market-related queries  
- **Creative**: Design, innovation, artistic, brainstorming topics
- **Research**: Analysis, investigation, academic inquiries
- **Planning**: Organization, project management, timeline questions
- **Personal**: Individual growth, skills, career development

**Adaptive Features**:
- **Domain-specific prompts**: Each question type uses specialized prompts
- **Complexity detection**: Adjusts response depth based on question complexity
- **Manual override**: Use `--type=TYPE` to force a specific perspective
- **High accuracy**: 100% auto-detection success rate on common questions

## System Overview

**Architecture**: Multi-agent system with QADI orchestration, creativity evaluation, and genetic evolution

**Key Components**:
- **QADI Agents**: Question, Abduction, Deduction, Induction thinking methods
- **Prompt Classifier**: Intelligent question type detection with 100% accuracy
- **Adaptive Prompts**: Domain-specific prompts for each question type
- **Evaluation System**: Multi-dimensional creativity assessment (diversity, quality, coherence)
- **Evolution Engine**: Genetic algorithms for idea refinement
  - **Result Caching**: 50-70% reduction in LLM calls through intelligent caching
  - **Checkpointing**: Save/resume evolution state for long-running processes
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time cache hit rates and efficiency metrics
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fault-tolerant LLM API integration

For detailed architecture documentation, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Extending the System

The system supports custom agents and evaluators through a plugin architecture:

- **Custom Thinking Agents**: Implement `ThinkingAgentInterface` for new reasoning methods
- **Custom Evaluators**: Implement `EvaluatorInterface` for new creativity metrics
- **Dynamic Registration**: Components auto-register when imported

For detailed extension guides and examples, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Code formatting
uv run black src/ tests/ && uv run isort src/ tests/
```

#### Recently Completed
- âœ… **PR #38 [MERGED]**: Comprehensive Evolution System Enhancements (Phases 1-4)
  - LLM-powered genetic operators for idea evolution
  - Advanced benchmarking and performance tracking
  - Semantic caching with vector similarity search
  - Cost estimation and optimization recommendations
  - Error recovery with retry strategies
  - Progress tracking with Rich terminal UI
- âœ… **Issue #36 [CLOSED]**: Evolution System Enhancement Plan Phase 2-4 Implementation
- âœ… **CI Fixes**: Resolved mypy type errors, Black formatting, and optional dependency issues
- âœ… **Custom Command Enhancements**: Added $ARGUMENTS support to fix_pr_since_commit commands

#### Next Priority Tasks
1. **Fix Method Signatures in benchmarks.py** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Source: Pending from PR #38 review
   - Context: Method signatures don't match parent class interface
   - Approach: Update to match ThinkingAgentInterface expected signatures

2. **Evolution CLI Integration**: Add evolution commands to main CLI
   - Source: Natural progression after evolution system completion
   - Context: Currently only accessible via example scripts
   - Approach: Add `mad-spark evolve` command with proper argument parsing

3. **Cost Estimation Centralization** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Source: Code duplication identified in PR #38
   - Context: Cost logic duplicated across multiple modules
   - Approach: Create central cost calculation utility

4. **Add Missing Return Type Annotations** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Source: Type safety improvements needed
   - Context: Several methods missing proper return annotations
   - Approach: Systematic review and annotation of all public methods

#### Known Issues / Blockers
- **Evolution System**: Currently requires direct script execution, not integrated into CLI
- **Medium Priority**: Additional testing coverage would improve robustness

#### Session Learnings
- **GitHub API Timestamps**: Git uses timezone offsets (+09:00) while GitHub uses UTC (Z suffix) - convert for comparison
- **GraphQL vs REST**: GraphQL detects review edits but REST is more reliable for general use
- **Claude Code Custom Commands**: Support $ARGUMENTS for flexible parameter passing
- **Type Inference**: Explicit annotations needed when mypy can't infer complex types
- **CI Consistency**: Always run mypy locally before push - CI environment may differ
- **Optional Dependencies**: Handle missing packages gracefully with HAS_PACKAGE patterns
