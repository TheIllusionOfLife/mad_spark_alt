import asyncio
from mad_spark_alt.core.simple_qadi_orchestrator import SimpleQADIOrchestrator

async def run_analysis():
    orchestrator = SimpleQADIOrchestrator(temperature_override=1.2)
    result = await orchestrator.run_qadi_cycle(
        user_input="How can we reduce plastic waste?",
        context="Focus on practical, scalable solutions"
    )
    
    print(f"Core Question: {result.core_question}")
    print(f"\nBest Answer: {result.final_answer}")
    print(f"\nAction Plan:")
    for i, action in enumerate(result.action_plan):
        print(f"{i+1}. {action}")

asyncio.run(run_analysis())
```

## 🧬 Genetic Evolution System

**Evolve your hypotheses through AI-powered genetic algorithms!**

The evolution system takes the hypotheses generated by QADI and evolves them over multiple generations to find optimal solutions:

```bash
# Evolve ideas with default settings
uv run mad-spark evolve "How can we reduce food waste?"

# Quick evolution (2 generations, smaller population)
uv run mad-spark evolve "Climate solutions" --quick

# Custom evolution parameters
uv run mad-spark evolve "New product ideas" \
  --generations 5 \
  --population 20 \
  --temperature 1.5

# Save results to file
uv run mad-spark evolve "Business strategies" --output results.json
```

### How Evolution Works

1. **Initial Population**: QADI generates hypotheses as the starting population
2. **Fitness Evaluation**: Each hypothesis is scored on 5 criteria:
   - **Novelty** (20%): How innovative/unique is the approach?
   - **Impact** (30%): What level of positive change will it create?
   - **Cost** (20%): Resource efficiency (lower cost = higher score)
   - **Feasibility** (20%): How practical is implementation?
   - **Risks** (10%): Risk level (lower risk = higher score)
3. **Selection**: Best hypotheses are selected for breeding
4. **Crossover**: Combine elements from two parent ideas (75% rate)
5. **Mutation**: Introduce variations for diversity (15% rate)
6. **Next Generation**: Repeat until optimal solutions emerge

### Evolution Features

- **Parallel Evaluation**: Evaluates up to 8 ideas simultaneously
- **Smart Caching**: 50-70% reduction in API calls through result caching
- **Checkpointing**: Save/resume evolution state for long runs
- **Diversity Preservation**: Prevents convergence to local optima
- **Real-time Progress**: Track fitness improvements and cache performance

## How QADI Works

### The Hypothesis-Driven Process

1. **Q (Question)**: Extract the core question
   - Input: "I want to reduce employee turnover"
   - Output: "What factors are causing high-value employees to leave?"

2. **A (Abduction)**: Generate hypotheses
   - H1: "Lack of career growth opportunities"
   - H2: "Poor work-life balance"
   - H3: "Uncompetitive compensation"

3. **D (Deduction)**: Evaluate and answer
   - Scores each hypothesis on 5 criteria
   - Determines: "Implement career development programs"
   - Provides concrete action plan

4. **I (Induction)**: Verify with examples
   - Google's 20% time → 50% turnover reduction
   - Hospital residency programs → 40% better retention
   - Confirms answer is broadly applicable

### Temperature Control

Adjust the creativity level of hypothesis generation:
- `0.0-0.5`: Conservative, practical hypotheses
- `0.6-1.0`: Balanced creativity (default: 0.8)
- `1.1-2.0`: Highly creative, unconventional ideas
