- Focus on LLM API calls, async operations, and memory usage
- Implement performance benchmarks for critical paths

#### ðŸ”„ **Create RESEARCH.md** (MEDIUM Priority) 
- Document QADI methodology background
- Explain genetic algorithm approach
- Reference academic sources and research foundations
- Include evaluation metric justifications

#### ðŸ”„ **Simplify README.md** (MEDIUM Priority)
- Focus on quick start and basic usage
- Move detailed architecture to DEVELOPMENT.md
- Clean up session handover section (move to SESSIONS.md)
- Improve user experience for first-time users

#### ðŸ”„ **Investigate Test Issue #3** (LOW Priority)
- Address any remaining test failures or issues

- Fix any integration test problems

### Architecture Improvements Completed

1. **Strategy Pattern Implementation**: Eliminated complex conditional logic
2. **Shared Utilities**: Centralized common functionality with comprehensive tests
3. **Type Safety**: Added structured types and eliminated `Any` usage where possible
4. **Async Patterns**: Improved timeout handling and partial result collection
5. **Error Handling**: Enhanced circuit breaker testing and fault tolerance

### Session Learnings

1. **Strategy Pattern Effectiveness**: Converting 107-line method to 6-line delegation dramatically improves maintainability
2. **TypedDict Benefits**: Structured return types catch errors at development time vs runtime
3. **Shared Utilities Impact**: Centralizing common code reduces duplication by 20%+ in evaluation modules
4. **Async Testing Challenges**: AsyncMock requires careful handling of coroutine returns
5. **Git Workflow Success**: Frequent, focused commits (4 commits) make review and debugging easier
6. **Type Checking Value**: mypy catches subtle issues that unit tests might miss
7. **Documentation Structure**: Separating development guides from user documentation improves clarity

#### Session Learnings from Previous Session

- **Template agents are meaningless** - Must always use LLM APIs for real insights
- **Sequential LLM calls more reliable** than complex async orchestration for multi-agent simulation
- **Documentation clarity critical** - Users were confused by template agent examples
- **Division by zero common** in performance comparisons - always check denominators
- **PR reviews need systematic approach** - Check all three GitHub API endpoints:
  - Issues API for general PR comments
  - Reviews API for formal review submissions  
  - Pull comments API for line-specific code comments
- **Gemini 2.5-flash Token Management**: Model uses extensive tokens for internal reasoning
- **Google API Response Robustness**: Empty content.parts arrays are normal on finish reasons
- **Genetic Algorithm Testing**: Random operations require retry logic for meaningful validation
- **User Experience Priority**: Direct, functional tools provide immediate value
- **CI Test Importance**: Never merge until ALL tests pass
- **Model Default Strategy**: Honor specific model requirements from users
