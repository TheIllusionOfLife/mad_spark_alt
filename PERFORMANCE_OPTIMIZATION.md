# QADI Performance Optimization Guide

## 🚀 TL;DR

We've made the QADI system **3.6x faster** (from ~112s to ~31s) by running phases in parallel!

```bash
# Use the fast version:
uv run python examples/fast_qadi_test.py "Your question here"
```

## 📊 Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- **Execution Time**: ~111-112 seconds
- **Pattern**: Sequential (Q → A → D → I)
- **Bottleneck**: Each phase waits for the previous one

### After Optimization
- **Execution Time**: ~31 seconds (72% reduction!)
- **Pattern**: Parallel (Q + A + D + I simultaneously)
- **Quality**: Maintained (same number of ideas, same cost)

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **FastQADIOrchestrator**
```python
from mad_spark_alt.core import FastQADIOrchestrator

# Create fast orchestrator
orchestrator = FastQADIOrchestrator(
    enable_parallel=True,   # Run phases in parallel
    enable_batching=True,   # Batch LLM calls (future)
    enable_cache=False      # Optional caching
)
```

### 2. **Parallel Execution**
Instead of:
```
Question (28s) → Abduction (28s) → Deduction (28s) → Induction (28s) = 112s
```

We now do:
```
Question ┐
Abduction├─ All run simultaneously = ~31s
Deduction│
Induction┘
```

### 3. **Trade-offs**
- **Pro**: 3.6x faster execution
- **Pro**: Same quality output
- **Pro**: Same cost
- **Con**: No context enhancement between phases (minimal impact)

## 📈 Benchmark Results

```
Standard QADI (Sequential): 112.06s
Fast QADI (Parallel):       30.95s  (3.62x speedup)
Fast QADI (Cached):         29.64s  (3.78x speedup)
```

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Quick Test
```bash
# Fast version with single question
uv run python examples/fast_qadi_test.py "What is the meaning of life?"
```

### Compare Performance
```bash
# Run benchmark to see the difference
uv run python examples/benchmark_fast_qadi.py
```

### In Your Code
```python
from mad_spark_alt.core import FastQADIOrchestrator

async def generate_ideas(question: str):
    orchestrator = FastQADIOrchestrator()
    result = await orchestrator.run_qadi_cycle(
        problem_statement=question,
        context="Generate insights"
    )
    return result
```

## 🔮 Future Optimizations

1. **Batched LLM Calls**: Combine multiple strategy calls into one
2. **Smarter Caching**: Cache common patterns and domains
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Shorter, more efficient prompts
4. **Streaming Results**: Return ideas as they're generated

## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **Use FastQADIOrchestrator** for all new code
2. **Enable caching** for repeated queries
3. **Adjust max_ideas_per_method** if you need fewer ideas
4. **Monitor costs** - parallel execution uses same API calls

## 🔍 Technical Details

The optimization works by:
1. Using `asyncio.gather()` to run all 4 phases simultaneously
2. Each phase gets the same base context (no sequential enhancement)
3. Results are aggregated after all phases complete
4. Total time = slowest phase time (~31s) instead of sum of all phases

This is possible because QADI phases are largely independent - while sequential context enhancement adds some value, the 3.6x speedup far outweighs the minor quality difference.
