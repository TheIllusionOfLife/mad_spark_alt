# Test Scripts for Mad Spark Alt

This directory contains test scripts demonstrating the Mad Spark Alt QADI system functionality.

## Prerequisites

Make sure Mad Spark Alt is properly installed:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Available Test Scripts

### 1. simple_test.py
Basic demonstration of the QADI system with minimal setup.
```bash
uv run python simple_test.py
```

### 2. working_test.py
Comprehensive test including both QADI generation and creativity evaluation.
```bash
uv run python working_test.py
```

### 3. evolution_test.py
Demonstrates genetic evolution of ideas generated by QADI.
```bash
uv run python evolution_test.py
```

### 4. custom_test.py
Advanced custom prompt testing with detailed output.
```bash
uv run python custom_test.py
```

## Using Custom Prompts

To test with your own prompts, modify the test cases in any script:

```python
test_prompts = [
    {
        "problem": "Your custom problem statement here",
        "context": "Optional context for the problem",
    }
]
```

## LLM vs Template Agents

The system automatically uses LLM agents when API keys are available, falling back to template agents otherwise.

To use LLM agents, set environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Validation

All test scripts include automatic validation of:
- Presence of all 4 QADI phases
- Generation of synthesized ideas
- Valid execution time
- Proper cost tracking

Look for "âœ… QADI result validation passed" in the output.
