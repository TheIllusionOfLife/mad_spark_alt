# Timeout Analysis Results

## Test Summary

### Integration Tests
- **Test Duration**: ~53 seconds per test
- **Result**: 3/9 tests passed before 5-minute timeout
- **Status**: ❌ NEEDS OPTIMIZATION

### Evolution Tests

#### Minimum Configuration (2 gen, 2 pop)
- **Duration**: 28.7 seconds
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Breakdown**:
  - QADI Generation: ~17s
  - Evolution: ~12s
  - Early termination due to convergence

#### Maximum Configuration (5 gen, 10 pop)  
- **Duration**: >5 minutes (timed out)
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Issue**: Timed out during QADI phase (generating 10 hypotheses)

#### Medium Configuration (3 gen, 5 pop) - from debug logs
- **Duration**: ~158 seconds (2m 38s)
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Breakdown**:
  - QADI Generation: ~60s
  - Evolution: ~98s

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **QADI Phase Scaling Issue**
The QADI phase duration increases significantly with hypothesis count:
- 2 hypotheses: ~17s
- 5 hypotheses: ~60s  
- 10 hypotheses: >120s (times out)

This suggests O(n²) complexity in the deduction phase where all hypotheses are evaluated.

### 2. **Fitness Evaluation Performance**
- Each fitness evaluation takes 10-20 seconds
- No cache hits for initial population (as expected)
- Low cache hit rate (5-18%) even in later generations
- Cache is not effectively reducing LLM calls

### 3. **Missing Batch Optimization**
- Fitness evaluations are done individually, not in batches
- Each evaluation makes a separate LLM call
- For 10 population x 5 generations = ~50 evaluations minimum

## Conclusion

**The functionality is working correctly** but has severe performance issues:

1. ✅ Core evolution logic works (completes with small configurations)
2. ✅ Semantic operators are functional
3. ❌ Performance degrades badly with scale
4. ❌ Cache effectiveness is very low

## Recommended Optimizations

### High Priority
1. **Batch LLM Calls** - Evaluate multiple hypotheses/individuals in one API call
2. **Improve Cache Hit Rate** - Better similarity matching for semantic cache
3. **Parallelize QADI Deduction** - Evaluate hypotheses concurrently

### Medium Priority  
4. **Optimize Deduction Phase** - Current O(n²) complexity needs refactoring
5. **Pre-filter Population** - Avoid evaluating very similar individuals
6. **Checkpoint Recovery** - Resume from saved state after timeouts

### Quick Wins
7. **Increase Default Timeout** - 10 minutes for large configurations
8. **Add Progress Indicators** - Show which phase/generation is running
9. **Early Termination Options** - Stop if fitness plateaus

## Next Steps

1. Implement batch evaluation for fitness scoring
2. Profile the deduction phase to find bottlenecks
3. Add better progress tracking for long-running operations
4. Consider async evaluation of hypotheses in QADI phase
